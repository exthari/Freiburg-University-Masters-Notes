# Freiburg-University-Masters-Notes
This repository contains all my university subject notes — organized by subjects and chapters, each as a PDF. These notes are mainly for personal understanding and quick concept revision, so don’t expect polished English or full explanations. It’s a collection of shorthand notes made while studying to grasp concepts fast and revise efficiently.
